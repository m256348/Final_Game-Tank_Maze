Welcome to the Tank Maze Game. As commander of your tank squad, you must ensure that your crew succuessfully drops off crucial supplies to injured allied troops and, most importantly, that you and your crew make it out alive.

As tank commander you must use the mouse to guide the tank through the dirt path that is layered over a sheet of frozen ice. One wrong move and you and your crew are terminated. 
This mission does not only require steady fingers, but it also requires some luck. Out of dozens of ways to get to the target area, only one is safe for travel. You must use your instinct and hope for some luck in order to complete this challenge and save your people.



*** Notes on Code:

The main code is run on the sandbox.py file, which imports several functions and classes from other supporting files.
If you go out of the maze or find yourself on the wrong path, a fail screen will appear letting you know that you have failed the mission.
If you get through the correct path to the target area, the time will be tracked and an end screen will appear letting you know of your succuess in completing the mission.
